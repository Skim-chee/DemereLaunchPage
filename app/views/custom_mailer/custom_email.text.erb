Whoopsie! Sorry about that, I clicked a button during our team all-hands meeting and resent an update email from last week. We apologize for re-sending that email and are working to ensure that emails can't be sent with a simple click of a button from now on.

Since I have your attention now, I wanted to let you know that demere has been nominated for DC's Best Technology Startup-- and our CTO, Tony Liang, has been nominated for DC's Best Technology Manager
