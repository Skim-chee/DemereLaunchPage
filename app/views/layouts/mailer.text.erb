Is your summer going well? Well it is about to get even better!

Demere.co, which you signed up for a few weeks back, is starting to on-board beta users and we can't wait to share it with you! Over the next few weeks we will be bringing on more testers to give us feedback on the design, functionality, features, and usability of our virtual fashion platform.

To gain access to the beta version sooner than all others on the list, share your unique code:

<%= root_url %>?ref=<%= @email.referral_code %>

with friends and family. The more referrals you receive, the sooner you will gain access!

Can't wait to gain your thoughts and feedback in the coming weeks. If you have any questions in the meantime until you are on-boarded, please don't hesitate to reach out to us via team@demere.co

Stay Classy,

Anna, David, Seean, and Tony
